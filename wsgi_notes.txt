The basic idea is that we use a wsgi server (e.g. cherrypy, waitress) to serve
the application. The application itself is made available as a wsgi app. The
wsgi server sits behind nginx.

To run a waitress-based wsgi server:

    python wsgi.py

This listens on port 8080.

To make nginx proxy for the wsgi server, you need to put `nginx-site.conf` into
the "sites-enabled" directory of the nginx configuration,
/etc/nginx.conf/sites-enabled. (At least, this is what you do on linux.) Then
restart the nginx server (sudo service nginx restart).

After that it should work.
